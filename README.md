## ‚ú® Design Philosophy

My design approach focuses on three core principles:

1. **User-Centered Design:** Every decision is made with the end-user's needs and behaviors in mind.
2. **Aesthetic Minimalism:** Clean, uncluttered interfaces that prioritize content hierarchy.
3. **Technical Excellence:** Websites that are as well-constructed behind the scenes as they are beautiful.
